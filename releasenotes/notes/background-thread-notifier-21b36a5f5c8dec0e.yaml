features:
  - Introduced option to send notifications from a background process
    instead of blocking the service response to send the
    notification. This option is disabled by default, retaining
    previous behavior. Enable by setting ``nonblocking_notify`` to
    ``True`` in the middleware configuration. When enabled
    notifications will be queued for delivery in a single process.
    Set ``send_timeout`` in seconds (default 30.0) to customize how
    long to wait for a notification to be sent before trying again
    in a new process.
  - Introduced option to customize the logging level using the
    ``log_level`` option (default WARNING).
